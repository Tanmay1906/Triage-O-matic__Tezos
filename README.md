# Triage-O-Matic using Blockchain

## Overview

A decentralized, blockchainbased cyber triage tool with advanced AI/ML capabilities for automated analysis and a nomaly detection.
The tool is designed to store 
  **1. evidence hashes,**
  **2. analysis results,**
  **3. case metadata securely**
utilizing a consensus mechanism like Proof of Authority,suitable for high-security environments.
It includes a triage tool that offers a userfriendly interface for investigators, allowing them to interact with the blockchain to store and retrieve evidence efficiently.
